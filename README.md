## 🌱 Story Behind Hum & Purr

Over the years, as we grow, so do our worries and fears. Our bodies, designed to protect us from danger, often confuse everyday stressors with life-threatening situations. This misunderstanding can lead to chronic anxiety, depression, and other mental health challenges.  

Nervous system dysregulation—a state of imbalance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems—affects many, often manifesting as pain, fatigue, seizures, bladder, and stomach issues.  

Two years ago, I begin my healing journey after struggling with debilitating anxiety. Through this process, I discovered the profound role of the nervous system, particularly the **vagus nerve**, in regulating stress and emotional responses.  


I was shocked to learn that **7% of the population experiences nervous system dysregulation**, yet so few people understand how their own bodies process stress.  

With the help of my emotional support cats, **Kako** and **Fafo**, who stood by me in my darkest times, I found comfort and hope. This realization ignited a deep passion in me to create a solution that combines education, simplicity, and emotional connection.  


Hum & Purr was born from this journey. 🐱🤍
